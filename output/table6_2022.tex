   \caption{\label{tab:dep_2022} Cumulative returns in 2022 correlations. This table reports estimated coefficients of regressions with the cumulative returns in excess of the S\&P 500 index for the banks in our sample from February 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023. \%
      In Column (1), we report the relationship with binned indicator variables of total assets measured in 2022q4. The bins exhaustively bin out all observations, and do not include a constant, so each coefficient is the average for each bin. \%
      Column (2) includes the binned controls for assets (excluding the bin for banks with total assets less than 5 billion dollars) and a constant, as well as the controls for uninsured deposit share, hold-to-maturity asset share, and unrealized hold-to-maturity losses.
      Column (3) includes  cash/ total assets and securities / total assets.
      Column (4) includes  tier 1 capital ratio and non-performing loan ratio.
       All variables are mean zero and standarized to have standard deviation one, prior to interactions.}
