   \caption{\label{tab:npl_capital} Cumulative returns correlated with NPL and Tier 1 capital. This table reports estimated coefficients of regressions with the cumulative returns in excess of the S\&P 500 index for the banks in our sample from February 1, 2023 to March 17, 2023 as the outcome. \%
      In Column (1), we report the bivariate relationship with the non-performing loan ratio (non-performing loans scaled by total loans) measured in 2022q4. \%
      Column (2) reports the coefficient with the the tier 1 capital ratio measured in 2022q4. \%
      Column (3) combines Column (1) and (2). \%
       Column (4) adds uninsured deposit share to Column (3). \%
       Column (5) interacts uninsured deposit share with non-performing loans and tier 1 capital. \%
       All variables (except for the cumulative returns) are mean zero and standarized to have standard deviation one, prior to interactions.}
